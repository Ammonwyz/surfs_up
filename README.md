The data shows that the rain is not that much in Hawaii. Only early of June has some high level of precipitation, but the rest June and December looks good enough to have a surfs shop there. 

Light rain — when the precipitation rate is < 2.5 mm (0.098 in) per hour. Moderate rain — when the precipitation rate is between 2.5 mm (0.098 in) – 7.6 mm (0.30 in) or 10 mm (0.39 in) per hour. Heavy rain — when the precipitation rate is > 7.6 mm (0.30 in) per hour.

Hawaii's average percipitation are 0.14 and 0.22 in June and December, and max are 4.43 and 6.42. So, the most time is light rain or no rain. 

In conlusion, W. Any can run a surfs business there without weater concern.
